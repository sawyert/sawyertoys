      <p><img class="img-thumbnail p-2 rounded rounded-3 float-end" src="/static/images/dad.jpg"/>Sawyer Toys was a business run by Alec Sawyer, my late father.  Although he had always made wooden toys as a hobby, the company started in the early eighties after he was made redundant from an engineering management job at Johnson Radley in Leeds.</p>
      <p>First of all he found work as a general woodworking business, and he spent time building kitchens and replacing window frames before concentrating on the toys.  Things progressed from local craft shops in Yorkshire through to supplying Fortum &amp; Mason's in London with dolls houses.</p>
      <p>The last customer before he retired was a man who ran a company selling magic tricks.  He would come to dad with ideas for tricks, or a fragile prototype, and dad would apply his engineering knowledge to produce a quality product out of wood that would subsequently be sold to magicians throughout the country.</p>
      <p>This site will collect together some images and memories from the company.</p>
